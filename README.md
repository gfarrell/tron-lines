# Tron Lines

This project is an experiment in programming an animated set of "tron
lines". These are inspired by the movie Tron, in which motorcycles zip
through cyberspace in an arena, trailing lines behind them into which
can crash (and then die).

The lines in this project choose their next direction at random, but
will not crash into each-other's lines (which have a lifetime so they
reach a maximum length).
